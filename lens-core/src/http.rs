//! One hardened `reqwest` client builder, shared by every outbound HTTP path
//! that must NOT follow redirects.
//!
//! Three call sites (`llm::llm_client`, `system_check::probe_client`,
//! `model_catalog::catalog_client`) previously each hand-rolled the same builder
//! and each ended in `.unwrap_or_default()` — which silently yields a client with
//! NO timeouts AND redirects FOLLOWED, dropping the SSRF guard. This module
//! collapses them onto one [`hardened_client`] whose fallback PRESERVES the
//! no-redirect policy + timeouts (it never degrades to a bare default).
//!
//! The TTS download client is deliberately NOT routed through here: it legitimately
//! needs redirects (HuggingFace `/resolve/` 302s to a CDN), so it keeps its own
//! builder.
